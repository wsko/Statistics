        "answer": "There are five reasons to use Amazon Bedrock for building generative AI applications.\n\nChoice of leading FMs: Amazon Bedrock offers an easy-to-use developer experience to work with a broad range of high-performing FMs from leading AI companies. You can quickly experiment with a variety of FMs in the playground, and use a single API for inference regardless of the models you choose, giving you the flexibility to use FMs from different providers and keep up to date with the latest model versions with minimal code changes.\n\nEasy model customization with your data: Privately customize FMs with your own data through a visual interface without writing any code. Simply select the training and validation data sets stored in Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) and, if required, adjust the hyperparameters to achieve the best possible model performance.\n\nFully managed agents that can invoke APIs dynamically to execute tasks: Build agents that execute complex business tasks\u2014from booking travel and processing insurance claims to creating ad campaigns, preparing tax filings, and managing your inventory\u2014by dynamically calling your company systems and APIs. Fully managed agents for Amazon Bedrock extend the reasoning capabilities of FMs to break down tasks, create an orchestration plan, and execute it.\n\nNative support for RAG to extend the power of FMs with proprietary data: With Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases, you can securely connect FMs to your data sources for retrieval augmentation\u2014from within the managed service\u2014extending the FM\u2019s already powerful capabilities and making it more knowledgeable about your specific domain and organization.\n\nData security and compliance certifications: Amazon Bedrock offers several capabilities to support security and privacy requirements. Amazon Bedrock is in scope for common compliance standards such as Service and Organization Control (SOC), International Organization for Standardization (ISO), is Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) eligible, and customers can use Amazon Bedrock in compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

Thus, directly fine-tuning the base model requires large amounts of labeled training records and a long training duration to get accurate results. To ease this burden, the customer can instead provide large amounts of unlabeled data for a continued pretraining job. This job will adapt the Amazon Titan base model to the new domain. Then the customer may fine-tune the newly pretrained custom model to downstream tasks, using significantly fewer labeled training records and with a shorter training duration."

        "answer": "You can quickly evaluate Amazon Bedrock models for metrics such as accuracy, robustness, and toxicity by using curated built-in data sets or by bringing your own prompt datasets. After your prompt datasets are sent to Amazon Bedrock models for inference, the model responses are scored with evaluation algorithms for each dimension.

        "answer": "Amazon Bedrock allows you to set up human review workflows in a few short steps and bring your in-house employees, or use an expert team managed by AWS, to evaluate models. Through Amazon Bedrock\u2019s intuitive interface, humans can review and give feedback on model responses by clicking thumbs up or down, rating on a scale of 1-5, choosing the best of multiple responses, or ranking prompts. For example, a team member can be shown how two models respond to the same prompt, and then be asked to select the model that shows more accurate, relevant, or stylistic outputs. You can specify the evaluation criteria that matter to you by customizing the instructions and buttons to appear on the evaluation UI for your team. You can also provide detailed instructions with examples and the overall goal of model evaluation, so users can align their work accordingly. This method is useful to evaluate subjective criteria that require human judgement or more nuanced subject matter expertise and that cannot be easily judged by automatic evaluations."

The filter will help block them if detected in user queries or model responses.\n\nWord filters \u2013 Configure filters to help block undesirable words, phrases, and profanity (exact match). Such words can include offensive terms, competitor names, etc.\n\nSensitive information filters \u2013 Configure filters to help block or mask sensitive information, such as personally identifiable information (PII), or custom regex in user inputs and model responses. Blocking or masking is done based on probabilistic detection of sensitive information in standard formats in entities such as SSN number, Date of Birth, address, etc. This also allows configuring regular expression-based detection of patterns for identifiers.\n\nContextual grounding checks\u2013 Help detect and filter hallucinations if the responses are not grounded (e.g., factually inaccurate or new information) in the source information and irrelevant to user\u2019s query or instruction.\n\nAutomated Reasoning checks \u2013 Help detect factual inaccuracies in generated content, suggest corrections, and explain why responses are accurate by checking against a structured, mathematical representation of knowledge called an Automated Reasoning Policy."
